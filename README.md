## Problem Statement
Classify electrical equipment (transformers, circuit breakers, capacitors, etc.)
from images using transfer learning.

## Approach
Compared three strategies:
1. Feature Extraction (frozen ResNet50 base)
2. Full Fine-Tuning (all layers trainable)
3. Gradual Unfreeze

## Results
- Best accuracy: 
- Training time: 
- Dataset: 

## Key Learnings
- Transfer learning works with limited data
- Fine-tuning gives best accuracy
- Pre-trained ImageNet features transfer well

## Technologies
PyTorch, torchvision, ResNet50, Python
